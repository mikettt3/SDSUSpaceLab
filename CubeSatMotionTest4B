# Accelerate all motors to rotate CubeSat hung in the testbed platform
# Make initial state, the zero state. Attempt to revert any deviations
# back to the initial state

# Update 21 Dec 2022
# Either integrate Gyro readings or use magnetometer readings and figure 
# out how to adjust for motor and MTQ running later.
# Or use VN200 if this IMU is being a PITA

# 20 Jan 2023
# Consider adjusting DriveWheels rates. Make it react faster to inputs.
# Next task. Design file so that it captures 0 point/initial state, then 
#  rotates some mount using the reaction wheels and then attempts to return 
#  to the initial state.
# After this, obtain angle values either from fixed MinIMU9 or from VN200, 
#  then do same idea of rotating and rotating back.
# Alternative: Take initial state array as 0 and figure out what 90 degress 
#  from that is according to the IMU and rotate to that point.

# 24 Jan 2023
# Incorporate VN200 angle values and gyroscope rates into these 
# equations. Remove MiniIMU9 gyro values. This can be used for sensor 
# fusion by someone else later.
