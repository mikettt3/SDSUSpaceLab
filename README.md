Parts, files and docs pertaining to the San Diego State University Space Lab Magnetorquer and ADCS Testbed.

This repo is for parts, files and documents that I will be sharing with specific people at different times. These items will be for work pertaining to the new Space Lab at San Diego State University. 
Once my project is done and I have left, I will likely delete this repo and the projects in it.
